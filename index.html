            I am a frontend developer with a strong passion for building
            user-friendly web experiences. My journey has been shaped by the
            support and guidance I received while learning, and I now wish to
            join the AltSchool family to impact others in the same way I was
            assisted. Looking ahead, I aspire to grow further and hopefully work
            with an international organization where I can contribute to
            innovative projects on a global scale.
